Thoughts:
- What do the chosen features tell about match results?
- What are the most important features?
- Identify relationships/trends between features

- In what period of the season does team A perform best measured in FTR, goals, shots, etc.?
- In what period of the season does team A perform worst?
- Luton Town FC only team with no premier league experience (data), how does this affect their performance?


Pitfalls:
- Accounting for period team dominance/weakness (use weights?)
- Accounting for teams that been promoted/relegated (use weights?)



Ideas:
- Database with ALL players and their stats (and possibly rankings)
- Database with all teams and their stats (maybe even a ranking)
- Database with all matches and their stats

- Could use databases (or views) with updated info computed by various ML-algorithms in order to display on webapp using psycopg2
